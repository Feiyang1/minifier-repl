# minifier-repl

## Motivation
See how terser/uglify remove dead code across versions. E.g. what it can or can not remove.

## Prior arts
https://github.com/Rich-Harris/terser-playground

Unfortunately they are pretty primitive and don't meet all my requirements.

## TODOs:
- Basic UI that takes input code and output minified code using terser
- Support options simple - take a JSON blob
- Support options advanced - let people enable/disable options in UI
- Support multiple terser versions
- Support sharing URL
- Various UI improvements
